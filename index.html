          <figcaption>Female tertiary enrollment has steadily increased worldwide since 2010.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p><strong>Design Decisions and Rationale:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Upward-sloping line with blue-green gradient evokes sense of steady progress. <strong>(+1)</strong> – It is persuasive but not misleading.</li>
          <li>Title wording “steadily” minimizes post-2019 decline. <strong>(–1)</strong> – It is slight rhetorical framing bias.</li>
          <li>Full y-axis (0–55%) maintains proportional honesty. <strong>(+2)</strong> –It is completely earnest design.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Data transformation:</strong> Aggregated  the world-level averages (2010–2020) from World Bank data; I also smoothed the annual noise for clarity.</p>

        <figure>

          <figcaption>Most countries achieved over 50% female tertiary enrollment by 2020.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p><strong>Design Decisions and Rationale:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The use of blue-to-green shading is to emphasizes progress. <strong>(+1)</strong> – Positive framing.</li>
          <li>The use of color scale could exaggerate green tones near 50%,which giving impression of universal success. <strong>(–1)</strong> – Slightly deceptive threshold effect.</li>
          <li>I also added circle overlays to represent data magnitude. <strong>(+1)</strong> – Improves readability through dual encoding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Data transformation:</strong> 2020 country-level female tertiary enrollment, grouped by region, circles scaled to enrollment percentage.</p>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="graph_3.png" alt="Gender gap instability" />
          <figcaption>Gender parity in higher education remains unstable in developing countries.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p><strong>Design Decisions and Rationale:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The use of orange-red gradient and sharp oscillations is intended for amplifying volatility. <strong>(–1)</strong> – Emotional color palette.</li>
          <li>It selected the developing regions only, which omitting higher-performing nations. <strong>(–1)</strong> – Data selection bias.</li>
          <li>Maintained full axis to retain proportional accuracy. <strong>(+2)</strong> – Honest visualization choice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Data transformation:</strong> Filtered dataset for Latin America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, then computed mean gender gap over time.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="graph_4.png" alt="Developed vs developing comparison" />
          <figcaption>Educational equality remains a privilege of wealthier nations.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p><strong>Design Decisions and Rationale:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>I truncated x-axis from 30 to 100%, which magnifies inequality gap. <strong>(–2)</strong> – Deliberate exaggeration for effect.</li>
          <li>The use of red-green color contrast implies the moral judgment. <strong>(–1)</strong> – Emotionally charged framing.</li>
          <li>Ordered bars by income group to emphasize inequality. <strong>(+1)</strong> – Persuasive but transparent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Data transformation:</strong> Averaged female enrollment by World Bank income level; axis truncation applied intentionally for rhetorical contrast.</p>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            The visualizations on page one shows the proside of the claim. Visualization 1 shows that
            female tertiary enrollment has increased steadily worldwide since 2010. This graph shows the
            global trend line between 2010 and 2020 with a steady upward slope in female tertiary
            enrollment. The blue-green gradient reinforces the sense of growth, and the deceptive
            technique could be used for selective framing, which is the decline after 2019 is minimized
            visually by color blending and title wording as “steadily”. The second visualization focuses on
            most countries achieving over 50% female tertiary enrollment by 2020. This map has countries
            shaded from blue (low) to green (high). In general, color green dominates the visual, which
            emphasizes global success.The deceptive technique used here is color scaling. The map
            exaggerates green hues even for moderate values (~50%), which creates an illusion of
            universal achievement.

            Second, the visualizations on page two shows the con side. The third visualization I created
            shows that gender parity in higher education remains unstable in developing countries. I choose
            to use a line chart of average gender gap over time for selected developing countries. The
            orange-red gradient and sharp oscillations highlight volatility. The Deceptive technique used
            here is utilization of color and scale emphasis to imply instability. Last but not least, the fourth
            graph demonstrates that education equality remains a privilege of rich nations. I use a horizontal
            bar chart to compare average female tertiary enrollment between developed versus the
            developing countries.I truncated x-axis from 30 up to 100% and contrasting red/green to visually
            magnify inequality. The deceptive technique used here axis truncation and emotionally charged
            color palette to create a stronger sense of inequality.

            From my own perspective, I lean toward the pro side. Although global averages hide large
            inequalities, the data clearly show womens participation in higher education has increased
            substantially in the past decade.
